All K (1 ¡Ü K ¡Ü 1,000) of the cows are participating in Farmer John's annual reading contest. The competition consists of reading a single book with N (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 100,000) pages as fast as possible while understanding it.

Cow i has a reading speed Si (1 ¡Ü Si ¡Ü 100) pages per minute, a maximum consecutive reading time Ti (1 ¡Ü Ti ¡Ü 100) minutes, and a minimum rest time Ri (1 ¡Ü Ri ¡Ü 100) minutes. The cow can read at a rate of Si pages per minute, but only for Ti minutes at a time. After she stops reading to rest, she must rest for Ri minutes before commencing reading again.

Determine the number of minutes (rounded up to the nearest full minute) that it will take for each cow to read the book.
