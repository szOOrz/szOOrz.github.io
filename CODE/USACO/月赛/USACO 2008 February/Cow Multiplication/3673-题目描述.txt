Description


Bessie is tired of multiplying pairs of numbers the usual way, so she invented her own style of multiplication. In her style, A*B is equal to the sum of all possible pairwise products between the digits of A and B. For example, the product 123*45 is equal to 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*4 + 2*5 + 3*4 + 3*5 = 54. Given two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1,000,000,000), determine A*B in Bessie's style of multiplication.

Input


* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: A and B.

Output


* Line 1: A single line that is the A*B in Bessie's style of multiplication.

Sample Input
123 45



Sample Output
54
